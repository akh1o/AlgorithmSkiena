### What is an algorithm?

An Algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.
The algorithm must solve a general, well-specified *problem*.
An algorithmic problem specified by describing the complete set of *instances* it must work on and the output after the running these instances.
#### For example:
`Problem: Sorting 
`Input: A sequence of N keys a1,...,aN`
`Output: The permutation of the input sequence such that a1<=a2...<=aN`

An *instance* of sorting might be array of names, like `{Mike, Bob, Sally}`, or a list of number like `{154, 342, 53, 123}`. 

An *algorithm* is a procedure that takes any of the possible input instances and transforms it to desired output.

### Insertion sort

There're many different algorithms for solving the problem of sorting. One of them *Insertion sort*. 
It's a method of sorting that starts with a single element (and sort that element until on place) and incrementally inserts the remaining elements.

```
def insertion_sort(s, n):
	j = 0
	for i in range(n):
		j = i
		while ((j > 0) and (s[j] < s[j - 1])):
			swap(s[j], s[j - 1])
			j -= 1
	return s
```

### 1.1 Robot Tour Optimization

`Problem: Robot Tour Optimization
`Input: A set S of n points in the plane`
`Output: What is the shortest cycle tour that visits each point in the set S?`

TODO: The answer is "traveling salesman" in Section 16.4 (page 533)

```
Algorithms always produce a correct result.
Heuristics usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.
```

### 1.2 Selecting the Right Jobs

`Problem: Movie Scheduling Problem`
`Input: A set I of n intervals on the line`
`Output: What is the largest subset of mutually non-overlapping intervals which can be selected from I?`

```
OptimalScheduling(I):
	While (I != 0):
		Accept the job j from I with the earliest completion date.
		Delete j, and any interval which intersects with j from I
```


### 1.3 Reasoning about Correctness

We need a *proof* to distinguish correct algorithms from incorrect ones.
Proof is indeed a *demonstration*. Correct algorithms require careful exposition, and efforts to show both correctness and *not incorrectness*.

#### 1.3.1 Expressing Algorithms 

The three most common forms of algorithmic notations are: (1) English, (2) pseudocode, or (3) a real programming language.
The heart of any algorithm is an *idea*. If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express in algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it.

#### 1.3.2 Problems and Properties

We always need a *careful* description of the problem that we intended to solve.
Problem specifications have two parts: (1) the set of allowed inputs, and (2) the required properties of the algorithm's output. 

`Ask the wrong question and you will get the wrong answer

The earliest completion algorithms would not work for such a generalized scheduling problem where the producers were allowed to schedule the movies with gaps in production (i.e. , filming in September and November but a hiatus in October)
Indeed, *no* efficient algorithm exists for this problem. 

```
An important and honorable technique in algorithm design is to narrow the set of allowable instances until there 'is' a correct and efficient algorithm. F.e, restrict graph down to trees, or a geometric problem down from 2-D to 1-D.
```

There're two common traps in specifying the output requirements.
(1) Find the shortest path from a to b. (What means under the *best*?)
(2) Find the shortest path from a to b that doesn’t use more than twice as many turns as necessary. (Well defined, but complicated to reason and solve)

#### 1.3.3 Demonstrating Incorrectness

*Counter-examples* is the best way to produce instance in which it yields an incorrect answer and to prove that algorithm is *incorrect*.
1. *Verifiability* - To demonstrate the counter-example, you have to able (1) calculate the answer calculated with an instance, and (2) display a better answer so as to prove the algorithm didn't find it.
2. *Simplicity* - is the important part of verifiability, by simplifying the counter-example, to make clear *why* the proposed algorithm fails.

Hunting counter-examples is a skill worth developing. Techniques to aid your quest:
1. *Think small* - The pros look at several small examples instead of staring by drawing a big messy instance, because they're easier to verify and reason about.
2. *Think exhaustively* - There're only small number of possibilities for the smallest nontrivial value of n. All cases can be systematically constructed by adding a third segment in each possible way to these instances. (Example is from 1.2: Selecting the Right Job)
3. *Hunt for the weakness* - If a proposed algorithm is on the form "always take the biggest" (check for [greedy algorithm]), In particular...
4. *Go for a tie* - A devious way to break a greedy heuristics is to provide instance where everything is the same size.
5. *Seek extremes* - It is usually easier to verify or reason about extreme examples than more muddled ones. F.e, many counter-examples are mixtures of huge and tiny, left and right, near and far.

```
Searching for counter-examples is the best way to disprove the correctness of heuristic.
```

#### 1.3.4 Induction and Recursion

**Mathematical induction**: You proved a formula like $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} n(n+1)/2$ for some basis case like 1 or 2, then *assumed* it was true all the way to n − 1 before proving it was true for general n using the assumption.

**Recursion**: The program tested whether the input argument was some basis case like 1 or 2. If not, you solved the bigger case by breaking it into pieces and *calling the subprogram itself* to solve these pieces. 

Recursion *is* mathematical induction. In both, we have general and boundary conditions, with the general condition breaking the problem into smaller and smaller pieces. The *initial* or boundary condition terminates the recursion. 

There could be very subtle reasoning errors. 
The first is *boundary errors*. F.e, our insertion sort correctness boldly stated that there always was a unique place to insert x between two elements, when our basic case was a single element array.
The second is *cavalier extension claim*, adding one extra element to our instance might cause the entire problem solution to change.
!TODO: Check for the correctness on second reason, there could be misunderstanding or error.

```
Mathematical induction is usually the right way to verify the correctness of a recursive or incremental inserion algorithm.
```

#### 1.3.5 Summations

Proving the correctness of summation formulae is a classic application of induction.
There're some basics summations:
- Summation formula are 'concise' (TODO:check to understand) expressions describing the addition of an arbitrarily large set of numbers.

$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(i) = f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(n)$
TODO: make it to the center

- There are simple closed forms for summations of many algebraic functions. F.e, since n ones is n

$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 1 = n$

- The sum of the first n integers can be seen by pairing up the *i*th and (n - i + 1)th integers.

$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i = \sum_{i = 1}^{n / 2} (i + (n - i + 1)) = n(n+1)/2$

##### Two basic classes of summation formulae
- *Arithmetic progression*  - We encountered a.p in $S(n) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} i = n(n+1)/2$ in the analysis of selection sort. The important thing is that the sum is quadratic, not that the constant is 1/2. In general, $S(n,p) = \sum_{n}^{i} i^p = Theta(n^(p+1))$. TODO: Not theta, find the symbol in markdown.

- *Geometric series* - In geometric progressions, the index of the loop effects the exponent, i.e $G(n, a) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n}a^i = a(a^(n-1) - 1)/(a-1)$

### 1.4 Modeling the Problem

Real-world applications involve real-world objects. You might be working on a system to route traffic in a network, to find the best way to schedule classrooms in a university, or to search for patterns in a corporate database. Most algorithms, however, are designed to work on rigorously defined *abstract* structures such as permutations, graphs, and sets. To exploit the algorithms literature, you must learn to describe your problem abstractly, in terms of procedures on fundamental structures.

#### 1.4.1 Combinatorial Objects

Common structures:
- **Permutations** - `{1, 4, 3, 2}` and `{4, 3, 2, 1}` are two distinct permutations of the same four integers. Permutations are likely the object in question whenever your problem seeks an “arrangement,” “tour,” “ordering,” or “sequence.”
- **Subsets** - `{1, 3, 4}` and `{2}` are two distinct subsets of the first four integers. Subsets are likely the object in question whenever your problem seeks a “cluster,” “collection,” “committee,” “group,” “packaging,” or “selection.”
- **Trees** - represent hierarchical relationships between items. - Trees are likely the object in question whenever your problem seeks a “hierarchy,” “dominance relationship,” “ancestor/descendant relationship,” or “taxonomy.”
- **Points** - represent locations in some geometric space. Points are likely the object in question whenever your problems work on “sites,” “positions,” “data records,” or “locations.”
- **Graphs** - represent hierarchical relationships between arbitrary pairs of objects. - Graphs are likely the object in question whenever you seek a “network,” “circuit,” “web,” or “relationship.”
- **Polygons** - represent in some geometric space. - Polygons and polyhedra are likely the object in question whenever you are working on “shapes,” “regions,” “configurations,” or “boundaries.”
- **Strings** - represent the sequence of characters or patterns. - Strings are likely the object in question whenever you are dealing with “text,” “characters,” “patterns,” or “labels.”

```
Modeling your application in terms of well-defined struc- tures and algorithms is the most important single step towards a solution.
